<p class="mulish paragraphspacing">I'm Jonaz, a student currently studying at School of Science and Technology, Singapore, with a strong interest in electronics engineering, technology, and sports.</p>
<p class="mulish paragraphspacing">I specialize in Python programming, microcontrollers, and both digital and analog electronics. I enjoy engineering because it lets me constantly learn new things, apply what I've learnt, and experience the satisfaction of seeing what I’ve built actually work.</p>
<p class="mulish paragraphspacing">When I’m not debugging or playing with batteries and jumper wires, you’ll probably find me at the gym or immersed in video games. I also take part in Model United Nations (MUN) and various competitions to challenge myself and grow both technically and personally, as well as get to know new people.
<p class="mulish paragraphspacing">I’ve competed in water polo since 2018, representing clubs in tournaments in various positions, developing not only my leadership but also collaboration skills, as I learned the importance of teamwork, hardwork, and perseverance thanks to my coach.</p>
<p class="mulish paragraphspacing">I enjoy bettering myself, knowing that today's pain is what leads to tomorrows power.</p>
