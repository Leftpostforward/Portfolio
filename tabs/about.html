  I’m Jonaz, a student currently studying at School of Science and Technology, Singapore, with a strong interest in electronics engineering, technology, and sports.

  I mainly focus on electronic circuits and microcontrollers. Over time, I’ve gotten into building my own PC, customizing keyboards, and experimenting with both digital and analog electronics. I picked up Python through a mix of school and self-learning, and I’ve also worked with C++ for basic microcontroller programming.

  Outside of technical work, I like learning more about physics and math, usually through YouTube or online lectures, as well as the occasional textbook. I also take part in Model United Nations from time to time, which gives me the chance to meet new people and improve how I communicate and think on my feet.

  When I’m not working on something technical, you’ll probably find me in the gym, gaming, or tinkering with something new on the breadboard. I enjoy learning, building, and figuring things out.
